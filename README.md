## Inspiration
The COVID pandemic has 
- we are increasingly online
- events are all virtual
- a great way to announce events is on social media platforms
- so people do this
- but also, everyone is all over the place
- in the world: in different time zones
- in their minds: different interests
- this makes it hard to be organized
- especially when the graphics found are not user friendly

## Entering Gregor
Gregor is...
- a ML algorithm to recognize text using Azure API
- and determine algorithmically which of that text is title, date, etc
- scrape all the info from the image that is required to create a calendar event
- then, create a calendar event to add to your google calendar
- so that you can stay organized and in touch, no matter where in the world you are
- named after the Gregorian calendar - bringing old tech into a new world

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into

## What's next for Gregor
- integrating with a browser extension so that Gregor can create calendar invites directly from your social media app
- determining time zone directly from the image so the user doesn't have to input it
- parsing more complex calendar images, such as with multiple events, or with graphical time blocking
- directly changing the text of an image to your timezone, within your app

## Tools we used
- Azure API
- Google Calendar API
- Framer design
- React front end
- All in Python
- Flask to tie together frontend and backend

## Use Gregor to create smarter events today!
